JSON data
=========

DaBroker's serializer translates arbitrary Python data structures to
a hierarchy of non-self-referential JSON-compatible `dict` and `list`
objects, which can then serialized without problem using almost any
generic serialization protocol (JSON, BSON, marshal, â€¦).

Python objects (excluding unstructured types, i.e. numbers and strings)
are translated to dictionaries with a couple of special elements.

    *   _o

        The object's type. Dictionaries don't get a type.

    *   _oi

        The object's identifier. This is a sequence number which is not
        unique across encodings.

    *   _or

        This is another reference to an object. The value is that object's
        `_oi` number.

    *   _o_*

        As the encoding needs to be 100% transparent, any Python dictionary
        keys which originally start with `_o` get an underscore inserted as
        the third character. This is of course reversed during deserialization.

An example:

    >>> from dabroker.base.codec import BaseCodec as C
    >>> c=C()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: __init__() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)
    >>> c=C(())
    >>> c=C(None)
    >>> from pprint import pprint as p
    >>> from datetime import date
    >>> now=date(2014,7,4)
    >>> p(c.encode({'one':e,'two':e,'now':now}))
    {'now': {'_o': 'date', 'd': 735418, 's': '2014-07-04'},
     'one': {'_or': 3},
     'two': {'_d': ['Hello', 'there'], '_o': 'LIST', '_oi': 3}}

The codec will not add `_oi` elements to dictionaries that don't need them.
It may not actually pack lists in dicts if that is not necessary.

Strings are always transmitted as plain strings, even if they are long
enough to benefit from reference counting.

Object types
------------

    *   LIST

        Python lists are encoded with the actual list in a `_d` element.
        They also get an `_oi` so that referencing them via `_or` works.

    *   date

        The actual date is the current Julian date in `d`. `s` contains a
        human-readable form which is ignored when importing.

    *   datetime

        The actual date is a Unix timestamp in `t` (int or float). A
        human-readable string with unspecified timezone (probably UTC) is
        in `s`.

    *   timedelta

        A fancy name for "number of seconds" (Python's `datetime.timedelta`
        type). The number is in `t`, the human-readable string in `s`.

    *   time

        A time-of-day. The difference to `timedelta` is that `time` is
        translated to UTC timezone when exporting. The imported result will
        be in UTC.

    *   Obj

        DaBroker's basic object type. `f` is a dict containing the
        non-reference fields of this object. Reference fields (i.e. those
        pointing to other DaBroker objects) are encoded by adding their
        keys to the `r` dict. All objects have at least one reference
        field named `_meta` which points to that object's type.
        The actual object key is in the `k` element.

    *   Ref
        
        References to other objects. Their sole content is a `k` element
        with the object's key.

        Keys currently are transmitted as simple lists. TODO.

    *   Info

        DaBroker's meta object. It describes the data fields of the objects
        whose `_meta` field refers to this `Info` object.

        The minimum data fields of `Info` objects are
        
        *   name

            The class name. Informative.

        *   fields

            A dict of field names which contain non-DaBroker objects, 
            transmitted when you load the object itself.

        *   refs

            A dict of field names which refer to other DaBroker objects,
            auto-loaded as soon as you access them.

        *   backrefs

            Other objects which refer to this one. Typically auto-generated
            from the data description.

        *   calls

            Methods. Transparently calls the corresponding method on the
            server.

        `Info` objects are themselves DaBroker objects and have their own
        `_meta` pointer. This chain ultimately ends at a singleton whose
        key consists of an empty list and which is its own meta object.
        This singleton is hard-coded in the client.

    *   _F, _R, _B, _C

        Field types used in DaBroker's meta object, corresponding to
        `fields`, `refs`, `backrefs` and `calls` lists. See `Info`, above.

        These currently do not contain any special information.

Specific serializations
-----------------------

    *   BSON

        As BSON requires a top-level dictonary, every message is wrapped in one.
        The sole element is `_m`.

    *   JSON

        No special considerations.
